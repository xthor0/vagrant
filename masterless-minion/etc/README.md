There is some work to do here...

1. the keys will NOT be committed to git, duh. I need to write instructions on how to generate the keys, how to name them, where to put them, and how to reference them inside of the minion. They are necessary so that we can access the formulae I think... an explanation of WHY may already be found somewhere in Confluence.
2. A better explanation of what everything is doing and why in the Vagrantfile would be cool, too
3. Test, test, test.
